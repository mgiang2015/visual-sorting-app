# Visual Sorting App
This is a web application that visualises 5 popular sorting techniques: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort and Quick Sort. This is a project for me to learn web development with ReactJS and NextJS framework.

For feature suggestions or bug report, you can open an issue on this repository.

## Website

Head over to [Visual Sorting App](https://visual-sorting-app.vercel.app) to try the app out! This app is deployed on Vercel.

## Existing Features
- Input array for sorting: Custom input or Randomly generated input, given number of elements and the range.
- Allow pause / resume of sorting process.
- Visually highlight which portion is sorted, which element is being checked and which portion is still being processed.
- Shows performance measures that one usually look for in a soring algorithm: time taken and number of writes. Time taken includes the animation in ReactJS, which results in a much larger timing than if you were to run it on your computer.
- Allow more than 1 algorithm to run simultaneously, so that you can compare between algorithms.

## Tech Stack
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)
- CSS
- [Material-UI framework](https://material-ui.com/) for the beautiful buttons and font styling
